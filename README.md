2. Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies
3. Run `npm run dev` then visit http://localhost:5173/

# Usage

Select an algorithm from the dropdown menu and hit the "start" button to see the visualization in action.
You can also change the amount of data so far from 50 to 500 numbers.
